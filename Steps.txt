Problem 1:
Create a customer_hive table on the top of 'customer' table created in the last session.
Calculate the maximum and minimum age of customer from the table.

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE customer_hive(id int, name string, age int, location string) 
STORED BY 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.hbase.HBaseStorageHandler'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ("hbase.columns.mapping" = ":key,
                   data_1:id,
                   data_2:name,
                   data_3:age,
                   data_4:location")
TBLPROPERTIES ("hbase.table.name" = "customer_hive", "hbase.mapred.output.outputtable" = "customer_hive");

select max(age),min(age) from customer_hive;

Problem 2:
Access the customer hbase table from pig and compute the maximum and minimum age
among all the customers along with their corresponding name and id.

raw_data = LOAD 'hdfs:/user/training/customers.dat' USING PigStorage(',') AS (
           id:int,
           name:chararray,
           location:chararray,
	   age:int
);

grunt> data = load '/home/customers.dat' as (age);
grunt> g = group data all; 
grunt> min = foreach g generate MIN(data.age) as m;
grunt> max = foreach g generate MAX(data.age) as x;
grunt> values = foreach data generate age,min.m,max.x; 
grunt> dump values;
